Q1. d. Which looks more like what youâ€™d expect a monochrome image to look like? Would you expect a computer vision algorithm to work on one better than the other?

    Red channel image looks better, because it is light. Not sure we have CV algorithms here.

Q4. d. What do negative pixel values mean anyways?

    Intensity of deduction pixel is greater.

Q5.
    a. What is the value of sigma you had to use?

    Sigma = 7.

    c. Which looks better? Why?

    Blue looks better. No visible noise at all. Why? Maybe something with green coding/green perception?
